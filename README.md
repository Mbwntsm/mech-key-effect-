# Keyboard Sound Listener

This project listens for key presses on your keyboard and plays corresponding sounds based on the keys pressed. It uses the `pygame` library for playing sounds, `tkinter` for creating a simple graphical user interface (GUI), and `pynput` for capturing keyboard input.

## Features

- Plays specific sounds when certain keys are pressed.
- Simple GUI to start and stop the keyboard listener.
- Supports custom sound mapping for each key.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python installed, along with a few libraries.

### Tools and Libraries Required:

1. **Python** (version 3.6 or later)  
   If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website:  
   [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Required Python Libraries**  
   You need the following Python libraries:
   - `pygame`
   - `pynput`
   - `tkinter` (This library comes pre-installed with Python on most systems)

### Installing Required Libraries

To install the required libraries, you can use `pip`. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
pip install pygame
pip install pynput

tkinter is typically included with Python, but if you're using a system where it's not included, you may need to install it separately (especially on Linux-based systems).

Setting Up Sound Files
The script plays sounds based on the key pressed. You need to ensure that the following:

You have a folder containing the sound files (e.g., .wav files).
You update the path to the sound folder in the code. By default, the sound folder is set to C:\ammunation, so change this if your folder is located elsewhere.
Configuring Key-Sound Mappings
The script comes with a basic key-to-sound mapping, but you can add or modify the mappings in the key_sounds dictionary. For example:

python
Copy

key_sounds = {
    'a': 'l.wav',
    'b': 'a.wav',
    # Add more key mappings as needed
}

How to Run
Follow these steps to run the application:

Clone the Repository (Optional)
If you want to clone the project from GitHub, use the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/keyboard-sound-listener.git
Replace yourusername with your actual GitHub username.

Navigate to the Project Folder
Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the Python script. For example:

bash
Copy
cd path/to/keyboard-sound-listener
Run the Python Script
Run the script using Python:

bash
Copy
python keyboard_sound_listener.py
This will open a GUI window with two buttons: Start and Stop.

Start Listening for Key Presses
Click the Start button to begin listening for key presses. The program will play sounds corresponding to the keys you press.

Stop Listening
Click the Stop button to stop the keyboard listener.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, consider the following:

Missing Libraries: Make sure you have installed all the required libraries (pygame, pynput, tkinter).
Sound Files Not Playing: Check that your sound folder path is correct and that the .wav files exist in the folder.
Permissions Issues (Windows): If you're running on Windows and encountering issues with accessing the sound files, make sure the path is correct and that you have appropriate read permissions for the sound folder.
